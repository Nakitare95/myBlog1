                If Indiana Jones and Martha Stewart had a baby it would be Sophie Hollingsworth. Sophie is an sailor, former ballerina, pyromaniac, and environmental scientist who is ultimately just a salty soul that gets really excited anytime she can get out into nature. She loves tacos, sewing hats, breaking a sweat, lectures at the Explorers Club and thinks a sunset over the water is absolutely sublime.
</p><br>
<p>Her passion for expeditions off the beaten track have led her to undertake uncharted treks and far-flung adventures most deem too inhospitable; including everything from descending uncharted rivers in Madagascar, desert transect treks in Namibia, and to living with indigenous communities in the Republic of Vanuatu to conduct ethnographic research. She is a sailor, has sailed across the Pacific Ocean, and holds a 200-ton captains license. At the time of certification, she was the youngest female to ever obtain a 200-ton MCA Yachtmaster Captains License.</p><br>
<p>Hollingsworth’s work has been featured by National Geographic and the United Nations. She is a Fulbright Scholar with a background in Environmental Science and Health Security from New York University, Harvard Kennedy School, and the University of Sydney.</p>
<br><p>
She is a Fellow of The Explorers Club, Post-Graduate Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and the first New Explorer Awardee. When not exploring / sailing Sophie consults for corporations on sustainability and lives in Sydney, Australia.

        <div class="item10">
        <p>The Sofia Log is an armchair adventure, tropical vibe kind of blog full of stories of adventure and misadventure on land and sea, recipes to cook over the fire, stuff that’ll hopefully make you want to get outside and explore. The Sofia Log is not about providing specific travel advice on where to travel and itineraries, but rather sharing stories of adventure, culture, nature, and food in the most remote parts of the world in order to inspire people to live more curiously.
        </p><br>
        <p>Firmly believing  the more that people get out and experience other ways of life the better the world will be. The stories are intended to spark your imagination and encourage everyone to follow their own passions and get out of your comfort zone, be that couch surfing in Philadelphia or trekking across Burkina Faso.
